# Eurovision-Betting-Odds

## Description
The program uses machine learning methods (KNN, SVM, RandomForest and others) to predict the results of the Eurovision Song Contest. 

## Running the code:
1. Open Jupyter notebook
2. Locate the project directory
3. In project directory go to folder notebooks
4. Open `Data_prep_and_machine_learning.ipynb`
5. Run all the cells
6. You can also explore the notebook `goal3_odds_compared_to_reality.ipynb`.

## Predicting a new year with new data:
1. Insert the new year's data into the dataset (if you don't know the value of a column insert 0)
2. In code under headline 'Creating, training and testing classifiers' in list 'years_to_predict' add the year you wish to predict(may delete all the other years)
3. Restart the kernel and run all cells
